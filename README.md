Face Reconition and Tracking System

This project is done on MATLAB and Arduino hardware.
In this project, we have generated a database of the persons we want to recognize in future. Recognition is based on Eigen vectors algorithm and tracking is based on Viola Jones algorithm. When a face is recognized by the camera, a particular id is displayed on 7-segment display which is powered by arduino. In tracking mode, camera moves as the personâ€™s face moves. Via serial communication MATLAB transfers data to arduino board which controls the camera. Its applications are enormous like security at railway platform, metros, airports, home application, attendance register etc.
