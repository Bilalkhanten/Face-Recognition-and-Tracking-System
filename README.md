# Face-Reconition-and-Tracking-System
Face Reconition and Tracking System

This project is done on MATLAB and Arduino hardware.
In this project, we have generated a database of the persons we want to recognize in future. Recognition is based on Eigen vectors algorithm and tracking is based on Viola Jones algorithm.
This application contain features like recognition of faces from still image taken by camera or from hard drive, tracking of faces which will observed by movement of camera in direction of faces and real time recognition from database. 
The graphical menu simplifies the operation of the program.
